# Aligment

In the distant future, humanity has developed an AI, but by their own imperfections, this AI gets corrupted and travels through time to take control of everything.
It arrives to what we know as the prehistoric era, this virus develops the ability to transform organic matter to inorganic, doing this, he takes control of dinosaurs and turns them into robots, achieving some kind of hive mind, now he has the power to destroy the meteor that crashes on earth, to get control of the future.
With the mission to restore the timeline as we know it and keep everything as it is, after various failed trials, humanity sends a robot to fix everything.

This is a game being developed by students from <a href="https://www.imagecampus.edu.ar/">Image Campus</a>
